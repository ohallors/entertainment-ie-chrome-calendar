# entertainment-ie-chrome-calendar
Chrome extension that when clicked will fetch the entertainment.ie listings
and display them with a link that can be used to add the event to your calendar.

Entertainment.ie only returns 5 at a time making it difficult to find events.

Also requires a server to be running, this is due to cors restrictions.
```node server.mjs```
